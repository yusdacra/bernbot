Please do not lament.
I will forgive you even if the world will not forgive you.
Please do not lament.
I will forgive you even if you will not forgive the world.

So please tell me.
What will it take for you to forgive me?
-
I will not quench your thirst.
For you seek the truth and could not accept that.
I will not quench your thirst.
For the truth you desire does not exist.

But I still want to quench your thirst.
For I am the one who cast you into the desert.

The snake in the well was happy.
For it did not care what was outside the well.
The snake in the well was happy.
For it had naught to do with what happened outside the well.

And you were happy too.
For you did not know what happened outside the well.
-
Who is the criminal, you ask?
Don‘t we search for them in this story?
Who is the criminal, you ask?
Do you even know what the criminal did?

Who's the criminal?
Who is the criminal who will kill me now?!

She dropped her beads in the sand. So the girl cried.
For one hundred years, the girl searched the sands.
They might be in the ocean, not the sand. So the girl cried.
For one hundred years, the girl searched the ocean.

They might be in the mountains, not the ocean. So the girl cried.
How many years will pass before the girl wonders if she really dropped them?

The first time, I would try harder to avoid
the inevitable tragedy.
The second time. I would be disgusted with
the inevitable tragedy.

The third time, my disgust would turn into anguish.
The seventh time, I'd be laughing by then.

I wanted to know what’s outside the well.
So I tried to claw my way up from there.
I wanted to know what's outside the well.
So I continued to climb even when I fell and injured myself.

I finally realize.
The higher I climb, the more pain I feel when I fall.

When my curiosity toward the world and my physical pain become equal...
I finally understood the meaning of the frog in the well.
-
Please tell me what happened this night.
This is like a box with a cat inside.
Please tell me What happened this night.
I don’t even know if the cat is alive or dead inside the box.

Please tell me what happened this night.
The cat in the box is dead.

What's outside of the well?
Is it something worth fighting for?
What’s outside of the well?
Is it something worth getting hurt for?

What's outside of the well?
I'm going to fight and get hurt in order to find that out.

I'm sure what's waiting is a beautiful world.
Even if I get to the bottom of the well again.

The key to the new world is my willingness to get out of here.
Even if I can get out or not,
I will eventually get to the new world...

Everyone is entitled to happiness.
The difficult part is accepting that.
Everyone is entitled to happiness.
The difficult part is fulfilling that.

Because from now on,
I’m going to live a much much happier life.
I’m not going to compromise with just this.
We’ll retrieve all the happiness that we missed.

100 years worth for me
1000 years worth for you.

What is it you wish to see?
I shall show it you to.

I shall tell you about it.

But please, do not expect anything.
As I'm sure someone like yourself who closes their
eyes and ears will find no meaning in it.

Committing a crime isn't scary.
The scary thing is admitting it.
Being punished isn't scary.
The scary thing is knowing the pain of it.

Neither crime nor punishment will disappear from this world.
Because humans are unable to know the future.
-
Why are you unhappy?
Is it because you're still chasing your dream?
Why are you unhappy?
Is it because you lost something precious?

If that's the case, shouldn't you be happy?
What an empty way of life it would be,
to have nothing to pursue and nothing to lose.

Someone once said it's like the air.
You can not see it, but of course it's always there.
Someone once said it's like the water.
It's neither sweet nor bitter, because it has no taste.

So of course, they perceive every day as uninteresting.
That's why everyone is unaware of their own happiness.
-
Why did you kill him?
Because he hit you and wouldn't apologize?
Why did you kill her?
Because she said terrible things to you?

So, when did you come up with those reasons?
Was it before you killed them, or after?

If you speak of justice, the others will laugh at you.
What a naive, helpless thing to say.
If you speak of evil, the others will berate you.
What a callous, cruel thing to say.

If you say nothing, nothing will be said.
So in the end, everyone remains silent.

If you speak of evil, the others will berate you.
What a callous, cruel thing to say.

Everyone remains silent.
But the truth is, everyone already understands.

She wasn't discouraged nor did she cry at her fate.
She was beautiful.
She didn't fawn anyone and fought them all by herself.
She was noble.

She shined brightly, like a divine figure.
I needed someone like her.

What is it that I seek?
Perhaps it is a knight from a far away land.
What is it that I seek?
Perhaps it is a shore that will save me from this eternal swamp.

There is only one thing that I seek.
What I would obtain will either be the kishi (shore), or shiki (my death).

I was the most unfortunate.
I knew that there was no exit out of this maze.
Then, he was the next unfortunate.
He did not know that there was no exit out of this maze.

But all the rest weren't so unfortunate.
They didn't know that they were in the maze in the first place.

The most intricate thing to find in this world.
Is it a needle that you lost in the desert?
The most intricate thing to find in this world.
Is it a crow's feather that you lost in the darkness of the night?

The most intricate thing to find in this world is,
Realizing your own erroneous contemplation.

Do you know what is the sin?
It isn't because you ate the forbidden fruit.
Do you know what is the sin?
It isn't because you listened to the serpent.

You still don't know what is the sin?
Then, that itself is your sin.

Someone is patiently warming an egg.
If you warm it with love, then surely it's happiness that will be born.
It will be filled with love and joy.

I am warming it with gas, so it's doesn't matter which kind of egg it is.

Today, a tiny pleasant thing happened.
When I opened a locker, I found a pin inside my shoe.
Even though there are 50 people in our class, someone chose me.
It's proof, that there is someone who thinks about me more than about anyone else.

I want to tell everyone about that tiny happiness.
That's why I put a pin inside everyone else's shoes too.

A princess in an eastern kingdom was courted by three noblemen.
Confused by the attractive suitors, the princess comes up with a challenge.
She named three fairytale treasures and told them to bring home one of them.
The treasure she asked for was a fairy tale. Its existence was questionable. And they knew it too.

One traveled to the east and disappeared in wreckage in the raging sea.
One traveled west and disappeared in a sandstorm in a scorching desert.
One traveled nowhere, shrugged his shoulders and replied,

Princess. The treasure you seek does not exist in this world.
Then how will you answer my question?
Asking for a treasure that does not exist. That is, it is proof that the princess refuses to marry.

One traveled to the east and disappeared in wreckage in the raging sea.
One traveled west and disappeared in a sandstorm in a scorching desert.
One traveled nowhere and left the castle with a shrug of the shoulders.

In the end, the princess never met a more attractive suitor in her life than those three.
-
A princess in an eastern kingdom gathered three maidservants and said,
One of you three stole my precious hand mirror. If you do not confess, I will behead you.
Your Highness, it was not me.
One was immediately beheaded.
Your Highness, it was not me.
One was immediately beheaded.
Your Highness, I am impressed.
One smiled and praised the princess.

When the princess was confused by what was being said, the maid replied,
These two were the culprits. I have nothing but admiration for the princess's insight.

The eyes of a mistress are not to be dismissed. It's quite amusing.
These two thieves were fearless. They must have wanted to return it to the princess in secret.
Hmm. Your insight is incredible. And where is my hand mirror?
Probably in the pocket of the cloak Your Highness wore last night.

The maidservant looked in the princess's cloak and found a hand mirror in it.
The princess became in a very good mood and rewarded the maidservant handsomely.
-
One day, the princess of an eastern kingdom was locked up in her bedroom.
Three ministers were in the room and said to the princess,
While you were resting, this castle has been taken by the enemy.
What a ridiculous thing to say.
The enemy is searching the entire castle to find the princess.
What a ridiculous thing to say.

The princess would not be able to leave her bedroom if she heard that she was going to be killed.
So what will happen to her now?

If she's caught, she'll be skewered alive and burned at the stake.
This is no joke. I don't want to be burned alive on a spit.
If you hide, you will eventually starve to death in a fit of anguish.
This is no joke. I don't want to starve to death in agony.
If you run away, you will be beheaded and executed in disgrace by enemy soldiers.
This is no joke. Is there no proper way for a woman to die?

Then one of the ministers offered her a bottle of poisoned wine.

Drink this and you will die a peaceful death and have pleasant dreams.
Hoh, that is a most attractive suggestion. If there's no other way to die, I would prefer the easiest way to die.

The princess drank the poisoned cup and thanked the ministers as she drew her last breath.

They watched the princess die in her sleep with a smile on her face.
The three ministers opened the door of the bedroom and went outside
