# bernbot

`bernbot` is a Discord and Harmony (soon to be supported for Matrix) bot. It is inspired by "Bernkastel" from Umineko.

## Features

- It can listen to a channel, record the messages and use them in a Markov chain to post new generated messages in that channel
- It can insult you (randomly or when you can't use shit)
- It has all poems from Higurashi that are written by "Frederica Bernkastel"; you can get one randomly, search for a poem with keywords or generate a "random" one
